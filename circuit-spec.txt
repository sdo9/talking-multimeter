Talking digital multimeter circuit - second incarnation

Copyright 2014-2016 by St√©phane Doyon <steph@electrons.space>
Feel free to use/modify.

Here are exactly all the parts and connections I used.
Listed part numbers are from Digikey.

Components and overall sections:
-Battery holder: 3x AA.
  Tried a PCB mount model (BC3AAPC-ND) but was too stiff.
  Ended up using a SBH331AS-ND, has cover and switch, although switch is
  unreachable in my final assembly, a bit big though.
-Battery polarity protection: around an IPP80P03P4L-04-ND mosfet, TO220-3.
-Battery voltage measurement section: a resistor ladder.
-Voltage regulation: around an MCP1700-3302E/TO-ND, TO92-3 (3.3V).
-Microcontroller: ATmega328P 28-DIP IN A SOCKET.
-Infrared input: around a 475-1075-ND IR photo diode.
  I had it projecting up from the board, through the case top, to end up right
  under the multimeter's emitter.
-Flash: Winbond 25Q80BV or MX25L4006EPI-12G 1092-1094-ND 8-DIP IN A SOCKET.
-Audio amplifier breakout: BOB-11044 (Sparkfun).

  Possibly available at Digikey even.

-Amplifier power control: around a ZXM64P035L3-ND mosfet, TO-220-3.
  Note this specific model was discontinued since.
  This is because the amplifier breakout's sleep mode isn't good enough.
-Button: I think the one I used was Tactile Switch Button 12mm square

-Speaker: Speaker - PCB Mount - COM-11089 (sparkfun)
  It's cheesy, but all my other 8ohm reasonably sized speakers are worse.
  I think this one does better because it's enclosed.
  My larger 4ohm speakers draw too much and the amp isn't rated for them.
-FTDI header: 6 pin header male.
  For reprogramming or communication. Possibly optional.

I used sockets for the DIPs.

I have no provisions for an on/off switch :-).

Battery polarity protection:
Battery holder - to IPP80P03P4L-04-ND mosfet gate.
Battery + to mosfet drain.
Battery - to GND rail.

Battery voltage measurement:
5 resistors in series, call them R1-R5, each 1Mohm,
forming a 5x voltage divider.
(1Mohm is the highest value I own...)
R1 to GND, R5 to IPP80P03P4L-04-ND mosfet source.
R1-R2 junction to mcu pin 23 (arduino analog 0).

Voltage regulation:
MCP1700-3302E/TO-ND regulator pin 1 to GND.
IPP80P03P4L-04-ND mosfet source to regulator pin 2 (Vin).
Regulator pin 3 (Vout) to VCC rail.
Ceramic cap 1uf on pins 1,2,
Ceramic cap 1uf on pins 1,3,
220uf cap between VCC and GND rails.

Microcontroller (ATmega328P):
VCC to mcu pin 7,
GND to mcu pin 8,
47uf cap and .1uf ceramic cap between mcu pins 7,8,
VCC to mcu pin 20 (AVCC)
GND to mcu pin 22 (AGND)
.1uf cap between mcu pins 20,22,
(there should be an inductor too but I've never used one.)
10K pull-up resistor from VCC to mcu pin 1 (reset).

Infrared input (475-1075-ND photo diode):
Reverse biased...
VCC to IR diode cathode,
100Kohm resistor from IR diode anode to GND,
IR diode anode to mcu pin 4 (arduino 2).

Flash:
VCC to flash pin 8,
Flash pin 4 to GND,
.1uf ceramic cap between flash pin 8 and GND.
VCC to flash pin 3 (WP),
VCC to flash pin 7 (hold),
Mcu pin 13 (arduino 7) to flash pin 1 (CS).
Mcu pin 18 (arduino 12 MISO) to flash pin 2 (DO),
Mcu pin 17 (arduino 11 MOSI) to flash pin 5 (DI),
Mcu pin 19 (arduino 13 SCK) to flash pin 6 (CLK).

Amplifier power control:
VCC to ZXM64P035L3-ND mosfet source,
10K resistor between mosfet gate and source,
Mcu pin 12 (arduino 6) to mosfet gate.

Audio amplifier breakout:
ZXM64P035L3-ND mosfet drain to breakout PWR,
Breakout GND to GND rail,
Mcu pin 6 (arduino 4) to breakout SDN (shutdown),
Mcu pin 15 (arduino 9) to breakout in+ (audio in),
breakout in- NC (yeah that's weird but there's less noise),
breakout out+/out- to speaker.
Volume pot connection NC. It's not so loud that you really want to turn it down.
We could increase the amplification (adding resistors to the breakout)
and add a volume pot, but then it'd consume more current.

Button:
One terminal of the button goes to GND,
the other to mcu pin 14 (arduino 8).
Note: can't switch this mcu pin unless making sure it's on a different
pin change interrupt than IR diode.

FTDI header:
6-pin header, call them pins 1-6.
Polarity: if closest board edge is up, then pins 1-6 are left-to-right.
Note: must disconnect batteries when connecting FTDI cable,
or don't connect the FTDI's 5V.
Header pin 1 to GND rail.
Header pin 2 NC.
Header pin 3 to IPP80P03P4L-04-ND mosfet drain (5V power),
Header pin 4 to mcu pin 2 (arduino 0 RX)
Header pin 5 to mcu pin 3 (arduino 1 TX),
Header pin 6 to a .1uf ceramic cap, its other leg to mcu pin 1 (reset).

Physical arrangement:

Thanks to my wife for incredible patience soldering and helping with
the physical construction.

We made the above circuit on an Adafruit Perma-Proto Full-sized
Breadboard

I have the batteries and board with all the above inside a box. The
multimeter is fixed to the box's cover. There's a hole through the
cover so the IR diode sticks out and ends up right under the
multimeter's emitter.

Keep in mind that both the talker module and the multimeter's
batteries will eventually need changing, so access must be possible.

I fixed the multimeter with a tie wrap across the holes of its foot
rest, and a custom made piece that holds the front part where the IR
serial connector would normally go. It holds the multimeter's weight
well enough for me. I have a hole through the cover to reach the
multimeter's battery compartment screw, and removing that loosens it
enough so the multimeter can be removed.
If I were doing this again, I'd try harder to modify either the serial
or USB logging cables.

I have the speaker and the button on a secondary board, set vertically
against the front side, with holes through the case so they show
through.
The purpose of the button is to toggle between terse and verbose mode
when the multimeter is active, otherwise it causes the battery level
to be announced.
